Welcome to Human-O2

Human-O2 is an Icon-Set based on Hydroxygen (Oxygen) -Icon-Set. The idea was born when I used the Hydroxygen-Theme on my Ubuntu-desktop, and I thought it would be really great if the Human-Theme would be so complete and wonderful. So I started to create a fusion between both 
To get an almost perfect Human-feeling I had to modify a lot icons. I also included some icons I draw in the last time, and some icons (free - non commercial) I found in the "world wide web".
A lot of icons in small sizes were corrected by myself OR for a closer Human-feeling modificated!

So I am glad to present you my result!
Feel the beauty side of Ubuntu - the Linux-distribution I use and like best ... enjoy 

If you like it, don't forget --->
